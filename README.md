## Description:
This program implements a **linked list** to simulate a customizable necklace where users can add, remove, insert, search, and display different types of stones. The linked list structure allows for **efficient insertion and deletion**, making it an ideal data structure for dynamic item management.

## Features:
- **Append a stone** to the end of the necklace.
- **Insert a stone** at a specific position.
- **Delete a stone** from the necklace.
- **Display the current necklace** with all stones in order.
- **Search for a specific stone** in the necklace.
- **Robust Input Handling**:
  - Ensures menu choices are valid (1-6).
  - Restricts stone choices to **turquoise, coral, gold, and copper**.

## Technologies Used:
- **C++** (Standard Library)
- **Linked List** (`beautifulbeads` class)
- `limits` for input validation and handling user errors.

## How to Run:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
